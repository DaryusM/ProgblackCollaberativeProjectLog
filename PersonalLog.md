Week of Sunday  25/2:
I have just gotten started with my collaborative project in a full capacity. The project in question is a an AI content farming system which has primarialy primary been developed by a fellow student: Josh Hales. I've spent a bit of time over the last several weeks, though in an increased capacity over the last few days, in order to get better aquainted with the project. Principally I've spent my time getting up to speed on typscript, which constitutes the main language of the project. At present Josh has set aside a few issue tickets for both myself and another collaborating student to work on in order to ease ourselves into the project. Presently I'm looking to progress towards working on the project development itself and shift away from primairaly handling issue tickets. 

Week of Sunday 17/3:
As of Sunday the 24th, I have completed all of my self assigned issues. Though the issues in question were not super difficult to handle. Working through them gave me a good idea of how Josh has structured his project. More importantly one of the issues I worked on involved doing a bit of typescript. Though the process of reasearching the nature of my issue was a bit tedious, I gained a bit more insite into how to work with Type Script and by extention Java Script. Given the fact that I have completed all of my issues, I would like to see if I can move on to direct project development. 

Week of Sunday 24/3:
One of my fellow collaberators was having issues on his end running npm install. As it turns out, the reason for this was due to my editing the os field in the package file. I changed the field from what it had been to the desired "win32" expressed in his error message, and included "win64" for good measure. I noticed, however, when I tried running the server, that the kernel seemed to make multiple attempts at installing the same set of packages before ultimately retuning a set of errors. After some reaserch and a bit of trial and error, I found that at least on my pc, using "npm install typescript" versus the deefault "npm install" seemed to successfully launch the server, which stuck me as a bit strange.

Week of Sunday 31/3:
I had a little bit of a quiet week this week, seeing as I've completed all of the issues I set out to do. Given that Josh and our other group member, Patrick, have a list of their own tasks and there are no other issues I can assign myself, I have reached something of an impasse. In order to remedy this, I contacted Josh in order to see if there was anything else he would like me to do. In order to occupy myself this week, I did a bit of research into why my server only starts with "npm install typescript", but I couldn't find a solution that worked consistently, so I will continue to look for something that does.

Week of Sunday 7/4:
Patrick reached out through Git Hub, stating that he was having trouble getting the server started again. Per his comment he was eventually able to start it by installing all of the dependencies individually. I told him that it would consistently start on my end with "npm install typescript", and recomended he attempt to use that. I had wondered if the issues starting the server may have been due to my fiddling with either the project's package file, or one of the other files in the directory. I checked through my prior edits, and found nothing that really should have caused the issue.
