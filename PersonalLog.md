Week of Sunday  25/2:
I have just gotten started with my collaborative project in a full capacity. The project in question is a an AI content farming system which has primarialy primary been developed by a fellow student: Josh Hales. I've spent a bit of time over the last several weeks, though in an increased capacity over the last few days, in order to get better aquainted with the project. Principally I've spent my time getting up to speed on typscript, which constitutes the main language of the project. At present Josh has set aside a few issue tickets for both myself and another collaborating student to work on in order to ease ourselves into the project. Presently I'm looking to progress towards working on the project development itself and shift away from primairaly handling issue tickets. 

Week of Sunday 17/3:
As of Sunday the 24th, I have completed all of my self assigned issues. Though the issues in questions were not super difficult to handle. Working through them gave me a good idea of how Josh has structured his project. More importantly one of the issues I worked on involved doing a bit of typescript. Though the process of reasearching the nature of my issue was a bit tedious, I gained a bit more insite into how to work with Type Script and by extention Java Script. Given the fact that I have completed all of my issues, I would like to see if I can move on to direct project development.
