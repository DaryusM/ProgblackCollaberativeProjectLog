Week of Sunday the 25th:
I have just gotten started with my collaborative project in a full capacity. The project in question is a an AI content farming system which has primarialy primary been developed by a fellow student: Josh Hales. I've spent a bit of time over the last several weeks, though in an increased capacity over the last few days, in order to get better aquainted with the project. Principally I've spent my time getting up to speed on typscript, which constitutes the main language of the project. At present Josh has set aside a few issue tickets for both myself and another collaborating student to work on in order to ease ourselves into the project. Presently I'm looking to progress towards working on the project development itself and shift away from primairaly handling issue tickets.
