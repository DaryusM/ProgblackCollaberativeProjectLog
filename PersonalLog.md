Week of Sunday  25/2:
I have just gotten started with my collaborative project in a full capacity. The project in question is a an AI content farming system which has primarialy primary been developed by a fellow student: Josh Hales. I've spent a bit of time over the last several weeks, though in an increased capacity over the last few days, in order to get better aquainted with the project. Principally I've spent my time getting up to speed on typscript, which constitutes the main language of the project. At present Josh has set aside a few issue tickets for both myself and another collaborating student to work on in order to ease ourselves into the project. Presently I'm looking to progress towards working on the project development itself and shift away from primairaly handling issue tickets. 

Week of Sunday 17/3:
As of Sunday the 24th, I have completed all of my self assigned issues. Though the issues in questions were not super difficult to handle. Working through them gave me a good idea of how Josh has structured his project. More importantly one of the issues I worked on involved doing a bit of typescript. Though the process of reasearching the nature of my issue was a bit tedious, I gained a bit more insite into how to work with Type Script and by extention Java Script. Given the fact that I have completed all of my issues, I would like to see if I can move on to direct project development. 

Week of Sunday 24/3:
One of my fellow collaberators was having issues on his end running npm install. As it turns out, the reason for this was due to me editing the os field in the package file. I changed the field from what it had been to the desired "win32" expressed in his error message, and included "win64" for good measure. I noticed, however, when I tried running the server, that the kernel seemed to make multiple attempts at installing the same set of packages before ultimately retuning a set of errors. After some reaserch and a bit of trial and error, I found that at least on my pc, using "npm install typescript" versus the deefault "npm install" seemed to successfully launch the server, which stuck me as a bit strange.
